`About This Project`

This project allows only one user (one IP address) to connect to the server at a time.
While a user is connected, no other users can access the server.
The connected user can increase or decrease a value.
Once the user disconnects, a new user is allowed to connect.

`How to Build and Run`

Compile and run the server with the following commands:
gcc server.c -o server
./server
